My collage is a transition from a classic drum beat into a more afro styled beat,
with some fun reverse beatboxing and cow noises thrown in, and a constant chime
tune that ties everything together. The cow noise was very different from the rest
of the samples, so I really wanted to use it to add a little element of surprise
to the piece. I ended up creating a repeat function as the cow noise only played
once, and I wanted to use it more as a beat.
